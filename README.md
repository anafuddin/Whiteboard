Making a tool for real time whiteboarding to deepen my understanding of using Convex as my database service.

2/3 Starting my project
- Added authentication using Clerk since they're the service I'm most familiar with, but I should check other services so I can see if other services are similar in use and installation
- Created Organization Sidebar UI and connected it to Clerk using their react components
- Added very rough dashboard layout using just bg colors and labels as placeholders for now
